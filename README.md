# ETHERA

ETHERA is a decentralized content subscription platform that empowers creators and users by leveraging blockchain technology. It provides a seamless, trustless, and transparent way for users to subscribe to their favorite content creators using [**Circles Protocol**](https://docs.aboutcircles.com/) for authentication and **Circles Token (CRC)** for subscriptions.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔹 Decentralized Authentication with Circles Protocol

- Ethera utilizes **Circles Protocol** for login authentication, ensuring a secure, decentralized, and privacy-focused login experience.
- Users can log in without traditional credentials, reducing reliance on centralized identity providers.

### 🔹 Subscription Model with CRC Token

- Users can subscribe to content creators using **Circles Token (CRC)**.
- The CRC token is used for seamless payments, ensuring a blockchain-native monetization method for creators.
- Subscription plans can vary based on the creator’s pricing strategy.

### 🔹 Creator Economy & Fan Engagement

- Content creators can publish exclusive content for their subscribers.
- Subscribers can directly support their favorite creators with **microtransactions** using CRC tokens.
- A transparent revenue-sharing model ensures fair rewards for content creators.

### 🔹 Smart Contract-Powered Platform

- The platform runs on **Gnosis Chain**, ensuring transparency and automation in subscription payments.
- Smart contracts handle subscription renewals, payments, and access management.

### 🔹 User Dashboard

- Users can track their active subscriptions, manage payments, and discover new creators.
- Creators can analyze subscription trends, view their earnings in CRC tokens, and withdraw funds seamlessly.

### 🔹 Decentralized and Censorship-Resistant

- Since Ethera is built on blockchain technology, it is **censorship-resistant** and not controlled by a single entity.
- Content creators and users have complete ownership of their data and funds.

## 📌 How It Works

### 1️⃣ User Authentication

- Users log in using **Circles Protocol**, which provides decentralized identity authentication.
